Status : GPL
Authors: Chris Rutter, Frank de Bruijn


Intro
=====
This is my adaptation of Chris Rutter's OSCLI daemon. The original used to
be at http://www.quantumsoft.co.uk/druck/ but unfortunately that link no
works.

This software is provided free of charge and 'as is'. It comes with no
guarantees of any kind. I think it does what it's supposed to do, but I
accept no responsibility whatsoever for any loss or damage caused by use
of or inability to use this software.

That said, if the program fails somehow, do get in touch with me and
I'll see if I can fix it.

Licence
=======
This software is distributed under the Free Software Foundation's GNU General
Public License (GPL), a copy of which should be present in the Documents
directory inside the application.

Installation
============
Copy the !OscliD application to your harddisk and include it in your boot
sequence (Run at startup).
You may want to change the last line in the !Run file to include a single
'allow' and 'deny' entry (see Documents.Security).

See the other docs in !OscliD.Documents for more information.
