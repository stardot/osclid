Purpose: OscliD client for Windows XP
Version: 1.00  (01-10-2005)
Status : GPL
Author : Frank de Bruijn


Intro
=====
The XP version of roscli was developed from the Unix version. It has no
provisions for channeling output back to the Windows machine (see the file
'roscli (RO/Unix)' in !OscliD.Documents).

It does support the same main functions, i.e. sending a command to the RISC
OS command line with:

    roscli <host> <command>

or adding it to OscliD's task queue with:

    roscli -wimp <host> <command>


Installation
============
Put the executable file roscli.exe on your Windows PC in a directory which
is in the PATH (C:/Windows will usually do).
