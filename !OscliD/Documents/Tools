Tools
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OscliD comes supplied with a load of "tools" you can use as normal
*commands, of the type that you are likely to want to use from a remote
computer.  They come with C source for perusal; particularly common
'good ideas' are to put Obey scripts in the !OscliD.Tools directory
called "dialup" and "hangup".  The tools require OSLib to be available
via OS$Path to rebuild them.

 Here's an overview of the tools:

 osexit    (executed simply by typing "*osexit" at the command-line or
           sending it as a roscli command) will quit the currently-running
           application, for example something that has crashed and is
           stopping the Wimp from polling

 reset     resets the machine

 restart   restarts OscliD

 mem       tells you the amount of free memory you have

 kill      will kill a running Wimp task.  For example, "kill ShareFS" would
           kill ShareFS (if loaded)

 Obviously these commands can wreak havoc if not used properly, so always
ensure that you've made your system secure (see "Security").

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

With version 1.07, the tools 'reset' and 'kill' are no longer included, as
their functionality has been added to the OscliD module itself. See the file
Documents.Switches for more information.

Also, the restart tool has been replaced by an updated version of a tool I
wrote myself years ago (updated means: added AIF header and - of course -
modified task_to_start$).
BASIC source is included, although it is NOT GPL but Freeware (but it's so
incredibly simple, there must be dozens of similar utilities about...).

Lastly, OscliD version 1.07 no longer modifies the Run$Path (for some odd
reason I absolutely HATE it when something does that...), so you'll have to
copy the tools to (one of the subdirectories of) $.!Boot.Library if you want
to use them.
